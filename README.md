# Core 

This repo contains code heavily influenced by fastai and specifically the 2019 v3 part 2 of the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/)

It provides a general-purpose training loop, learner, data-block, and architecture suitable for [neural splicing](https://github.com/mb4310/legacy-splice), as well
as some examples on how to use the Callback system for things ranging from  tracking gradients/activations to plotting distributions diagrams, scheduling parameters during training, etc.
